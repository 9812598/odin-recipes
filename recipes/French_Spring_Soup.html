        <p>I make this during asparagus season when my husband's patch is producing a lot. It is very fresh tasting, and the longer it sits, the better it is.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Â¼ cup butter</li>
           <li>1 pound leeks, chopped</li>
           <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
           <li>2 quarts water</li>
           <li>3 large potatoes, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2> 
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the leeks and onion, and cook until tender.</li>
            <li>Pour water into the pot. Mix in potatoes, carrots, asparagus, and rice. Season with salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 30 minutes, until vegetables and rice are tender.</li>
            <li>Stir spinach and heavy cream into the soup mixture, and continue cooking about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
